    Qiskit C++ supports transpiling quantum circuits through Qiskit C-API.
    Before running a quantum circuit with Qiskit C++'s sampler, a circuit
    should be transpiled with the backend object.
    The backend can be obtained by `QiskitRuntimeService::backend` function
    with the name of the backend.
    See `test/sampler_test.cpp`
